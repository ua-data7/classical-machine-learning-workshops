## Description

Python has taken most of the hype as the most widely used programming language for machine learning. This has left R users with a choice: 1. learn Python or 2. don't do machine learning very well. Enter [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/), Posit's solution to machine learning in R, using a framework similar to the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

In this session of the Classical Machine Learning workshop series, we will measure how well a model predicts new data utilizing the `tidymodels` framework in R. This is the first necessary step towards the more sophisticated models that we will deploy later in this series.

This workshop borrows heavily from open source materials hosted on [tidymodels.org](https://www.tidymodels.org/) found [here](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/models/). The author replaced the original `cells` data with [@zhang2021] which is described below. As a result, much or the text was changed to reflect a different classification problem.

### Objectives:

1.  Load and examine data
2.  Build and fit a model to predict
3.  Tube hyperparameters
4.  Model tuning with a grid
5.  Finalize the model

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

Some model parameters cannot be learned directly from a data set during model training; these kinds of parameters are called **hyperparameters**. Some examples of hyperparameters include the number of predictors that are sampled at splits in a tree-based model (we call this `mtry` in tidymodels) or the learning rate in a boosted tree model (we call this `learn_rate`). Instead of learning these kinds of hyperparameters during model training, we can *estimate* the best values for these values by training many models on resampled data sets and exploring how well all these models perform. This process is called **tuning**.

To use code in this article, you will need to install the following packages: `RCurl`, `rpart`, `rpart.plot`, `tidymodels`, and `vip`.

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidymodels)  # for the parsnip package, along with the rest of tidymodels

# Helper packages
library(RCurl)       # for reading in text files from a URL
library(rpart.plot)  # for visualizing a decision tree
library(vip)         # for variable importance plots

# Set theme for ggplots
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 14)) 
theme_update(legend.position = "right")
```

## Precipitation temporal repacking data

In our previous [*Evaluate your model with resampling*](https://gchism.quarto.pub/tidymodels-evaluate-your-model-with-resampling/) article, we introduced a data set of bunchgrass samples that were labeled `S1`-`S4`, representing four field precipitation treatments. We trained a [random forest model](https://gchism.quarto.pub/tidymodels-evaluate-your-model-with-resampling/#modeling) to predict which samples are classified as what treatment, so that a biologist could assess whether the features actually correspond to the treatments. Note that a statistical model could perform this as well, but its a valuable case use nonetheless since new data may be missing treatment labels. We used [resampling](https://gchism.quarto.pub/tidymodels-evaluate-your-model-with-resampling/#resampling-to-the-rescue) to estimate the performance of our model on this data.

Let's again use the data from [@zhang2021] which is from a study that investigates the effects of larger, fewer precipitation events (due to climate change) on a semi-arid bunchgrass ecosystem. The data examine water flux in bunchgrass across four field precipitation treatments `Treatment` (`S1`-`S4`) and five community blocks `block` (`H1`-`H5`).

**`Treatment`**:

-   `S1`: 3.5 days dry interval

-   `S2`: 7 days dry interval

-   `S3`: 14 days dry interval

-   `S4`: 21 days dry interval

**Note** that the original data are still modified as described in the previous [*Evaluate your model with resampling*](https://gchism.quarto.pub/tidymodels-evaluate-your-model-with-resampling/)article.

```{r read-data}
# Read in csv from the web
data <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ua-data7/classical-machine-learning-workshops/main/Workshops/Spring2023/2023-Mar-29/FE_2021_Classification_mod.csv")
data <- read.csv(text = data) %>%
  mutate(Treatment = factor(Treatment),
         block = factor(block),
         Repro_culm = as.numeric(Repro_culm))
```

### Examine the data

```{r head-data}
data %>%
  head()
```

For each of the precipitation treatments (`Treatment`) and community block (`block`), we know their:

-   `NEE`: Net ecosystem exchange, measured as whole-plot CO$_2$ flux( $F_c$, μmol m$^-2$ s$^-1$).

-   `ER`: Ecosystem respiration, measured as CO$_2$ exchange (μmol m$^-2$ s$^-1$)

-   `Repro_culm`: Number of reproductive inflorescence (flowers) (plant$^-1$)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Predicting Treatment, but Better

Random forest models are a tree-based ensemble method, and typically perform well with [default hyperparameters](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/random-forest.html#out-of-the-box-performance). However, the accuracy of some other tree-based models, such as [boosted tree models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Gradient_tree_boosting) or [decision tree models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree), can be sensitive to the values of hyperparameters. In this article, we will train a **decision tree** model. There are several hyperparameters for decision tree models that can be tuned for better performance. Let\'s explore:

-   the complexity parameter (which we call `cost_complexity` in tidymodels) for the tree, and

-   the maximum `tree_depth`.

Tuning these hyperparameters can improve model performance because decision tree models are prone to [overfitting](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/important-concepts.html#overfitting). This happens because single tree models tend to fit the training data *too well* --- so well, in fact, that they over-learn patterns present in the training data that end up being detrimental when predicting new data.

We will tune the model hyperparameters to avoid overfitting. Tuning the value of `cost_complexity` helps by [pruning](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/DT.html#pruning) back our tree. It adds a cost, or penalty, to error rates of more complex trees; a cost closer to zero decreases the number tree nodes pruned and is more likely to result in an overfit tree. However, a high cost increases the number of tree nodes pruned and can result in the opposite problem---an underfit tree. Tuning `tree_depth`, on the other hand, helps by [stopping](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/DT.html#early-stopping) our tree from growing after it reaches a certain depth. We want to tune these hyperparameters to find what those two values should be for our model to do the best job predicting image segmentation.

Before we start the tuning process, we split our data into training and testing sets, just like when we trained the model with one default set of hyperparameters. As [before](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/resampling/), we can use `strata = class` if we want our training and testing sets to be created using stratified sampling so that both have the same proportion of both kinds of segmentation.

```{r data-split}
set.seed(333)
FE_split <- initial_split(data, strata = Treatment)

FE_train <- training(FE_split)
FE_test  <- testing(FE_split)
```

We use the training data for tuning the model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tuning Hyperparameters

Let\'s start with the parsnip package, using a [`decision_tree()`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/decision_tree.html) model with the [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html) engine. To tune the decision tree hyperparameters `cost_complexity` and `tree_depth`, we create a model specification that identifies which hyperparameters we plan to tune.

```{r tune-params}
tune_spec <- 
  decision_tree(
    cost_complexity = tune(),
    tree_depth = tune()
  ) %>% 
  set_engine("rpart") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

tune_spec
```

Think of `tune()` here as a placeholder. After the tuning process, we will select a single numeric value for each of these hyperparameters. For now, we specify our parsnip model object and identify the hyperparameters we will `tune()`.

We can\'t train this specification on a single data set (such as the entire training set) and learn what the hyperparameter values should be, but we *can* train many models using resampled data and see which models turn out best. We can create a regular grid of values to try using some convenience functions for each hyperparameter:

```{r tree-grid}
tree_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(),
                          tree_depth(),
                          levels = 5)
```

The function [`grid_regular()`](https://dials.tidymodels.org/reference/grid_regular.html) is from the [dials](https://dials.tidymodels.org/) package. It chooses sensible values to try for each hyperparameter; here, we asked for 5 of each. Since we have two to tune, `grid_regular()` returns 5 $\times$ 5 = 25 different possible tuning combinations to try in a tidy tibble format.

```{r tree-grid-show}
tree_grid
```

Armed with our grid filled with 25 candidate decision tree models, let\'s create [cross-validation folds](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/resampling/) for tuning:

```{r vfold}
set.seed(234)

FE_folds <- vfold_cv(FE_train)
```

Tuning in tidymodels requires a resampled object created with the [rsample](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/) package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model Tuning with Grid

We are ready to tune! Let\'s use [`tune_grid()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_grid.html) to fit models at all the different values we chose for each tuned hyperparameter. There are several options for building the object for tuning:

-   Tune a model specification along with a recipe or model, or

-   Tune a [`workflow()`](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/) that bundles together a model specification and a recipe or model preprocessor.

Here we use a `workflow()` with a straightforward formula; if this model required more involved data preprocessing, we could use `add_recipe()` instead of `add_formula()`.

```{r tune-grid}
set.seed(345)

tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(tune_spec) %>%
  add_formula(Treatment ~ .)

tree_res <- 
  tree_wf %>% 
  tune_grid(
    resamples = FE_folds,
    grid = tree_grid
  )

tree_res
```

Once we have our tuning results, we can both explore them through visualization and then select the best result. The function `collect_metrics()` gives us a tidy tibble with all the results. We had 25 candidate models and two metrics, `accuracy` and `roc_auc`, and we get a row for each `.metric` and model.

```{r collect-mets}
tree_res %>%
  collect_metrics()
```

We might get more out of plotting these results:

```{r plot-metrics}
tree_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  mutate(tree_depth = factor(tree_depth)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(cost_complexity, mean, color = tree_depth)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~ .metric, scales = "free", nrow = 2) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number()) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma", begin = 0.9, end = 0)
```

We can see that our \"stubbiest\" tree, with a depth of 1, is the worst model according to both metrics and across all candidate values of `cost_complexity`. Our deepest tree, with a depth of 15, did better. However, the best tree seems to be between these values with a tree depth of 4. The [`show_best()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/show_best.html) function shows us the top 5 candidate models by default:

```{r best-model}
tree_res %>%
  show_best("accuracy")
```

We can also use the [`select_best()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/show_best.html) function to pull out the single set of hyperparameter values for our best decision tree model:

```{r best-model-tree}
best_tree <- tree_res %>%
  select_best("accuracy")

best_tree
```

These are the values for `tree_depth` and `cost_complexity` that maximize accuracy in this data set of cell images.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Finalizing our Model

We can update (or \"finalize\") our workflow object `tree_wf` with the values from `select_best()`.

```{r final-model}
final_wf <- 
  tree_wf %>% 
  finalize_workflow(best_tree)

final_wf
```

Our tuning is done!

### The Last Fit

Finally, let\'s fit this final model to the training data and use our test data to estimate the model performance we expect to see with new data. We can use the function [`last_fit()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/last_fit.html) with our finalized model; this function *fits* the finalized model on the full training data set and *evaluates* the finalized model on the testing data.

```{r final-fit}
final_fit <- 
  final_wf %>%
  last_fit(FE_split) 

final_fit %>%
  collect_metrics()

final_fit %>%
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(Treatment, c(.pred_S1, .pred_S2, .pred_S3, .pred_S4)) %>% 
  autoplot()
```

The performance metrics from the test set indicate that we did not overfit during our tuning procedure.

The `final_fit` object contains a finalized, fitted workflow that you can use for predicting on new data or further understanding the results. You may want to extract this object, using [one of the `extract_` helper functions](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/extract-tune.html).

```{r wf-final-fit}
final_tree <- extract_workflow(final_fit)
final_tree
```

We can create a visualization of the decision tree using another helper function to extract the underlying engine-specific fit.

```{r plot-tree}
final_tree %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot(roundint = FALSE)
```

Perhaps we would also like to understand what variables are important in this final model. We can use the [vip](https://koalaverse.github.io/vip/) package to estimate variable importance [based on the model\'s structure](https://koalaverse.github.io/vip/reference/vi_model.html#details).

```{r vip}
final_tree %>% 
  extract_fit_parsnip() %>% 
  vip()
```

These are the sample traits that matter the most. It is not surprising that `Repro_culm` is the most important because it is only collected once for each `block` and `treatment` combination. This could however be a problem because the values are repeated and not new data over time.

We leave it to the reader to explore whether you can tune a different decision tree hyperparameter. You can explore the [reference docs](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/parsnip/#models), or use the `args()` function to see which parsnip object arguments are available:

```{r args-tree}
args(decision_tree)
```

You could tune the other hyperparameter we didn\'t use here, `min_n`, which sets the minimum `n` to split at any node. This is another early stopping method for decision trees that can help prevent overfitting. Use this [searchable table](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/parsnip/#model-args) to find the original argument for `min_n` in the rpart package ([hint](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/rpart/html/rpart.control.html)). See whether you can tune a different combination of hyperparameters and/or values to improve a tree\'s ability to predict cell segmentation quality.
